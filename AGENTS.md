# SOD1820 — Session startup

At the start of every SOD1820 session, verify access to the canonical
Supabase project `linswmnnkjxvweumprav` with a read-only connection check.
Do not assume authentication persists from another session.
Prefer `sod1820_supabase_readonly` when available. If using the general
Supabase connector, report that distinction and execute only read-only checks.
Report unavailable tools or required OAuth approval; never request passwords
or API keys in chat.
Do not change data, permissions, or configuration during startup.

Read `CLAUDE.md` and `SOD1820_MASTER_OWNER_INDEX.md` for canonical routing.
This file adds a startup instruction only; it does not replace live canonical
owners or authorize writes, task claims, merges, or deployments.
